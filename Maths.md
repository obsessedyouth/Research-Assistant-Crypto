I'm using `Latex` so you can parse the equations with the proper mathematical notation and
generally because I'm more comfortable writing equations using this.
Although github's flavor of markdown does not render it, these are embedded snippets from

detail in the `root` of this repository as `Math.pdf` the actual `tex` file is in `equations`.

## Question

Over all real numbers, find the minimum value of a positive real number,
y such that:
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y%20%3D%20sqrt%28%28x+6%29%5E2%20+%2025%29%20+%20sqrt%28%28x-6%29%5E2%20+%20121%29)

## Answer
To find the minimum value we first take the differential:
