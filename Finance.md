`Q.2` is separately rendered using `LaTex`. This was by far the most difficult section of these, because I'm very much
unfamiliar with quantitative finance, and I have never tried to understand block chain, until this application. 
Which isn't to say *I know nothing* about economics or smart contracts, simply that I have never actively tried to 
learn it properly until now. If a human does get to read this and I do end up being rejected for whatever reason, 
I'd very much like feedback as to what I didn't quite get right and how I can do better. This is a polite request :)

  The continuously-compounded risk-free rate is 3%/year, the mean return on the
stock is 7%/year, and the standard deviation of the stock return is 40%/year. What is the Black-Scholes call price?
